    \justify{Most families in our country like to celebrate weddings grandly with friends and family. Thus the organization of a wedding following our wedding culture is quite tiresome and requires a lot of time to look for different vendors that align with the overall requirements. Despite this hectic wedding culture we follow, there is very few application or websites to help in the process. Thus this web application will help organizing weddings so that the entire tiring process can be easy and time-effective. This platform will help search, analyze and book wedding vendors such as photographers, makeup artists, caterers, decorators etc. based on the user's requirements.}\\[1cm]
